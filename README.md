# merkle-tree-solidity

Bare-bones Merkle Tree implementation, based on [miguelmota/merkletreejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/merkletreejs)

**This package is intended for use in tests written in Solidity, and is not gas-optimized in any way.** In fact, there are consciously wasteful choices made for ease of use.
